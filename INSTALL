and dump the structure of /sql/japxlate_structure.sql into it

* Rename configuration.php.SAMPLE in /conf to configuration.php 

* Put your MySQL credentials (for the above created schema) in above configuration.php

* You'll need a Twitter account and then a "My application" (so you can get some OAuth access tokens etc). You'll want "Read, Write and Access direct messages" permission.
Callback URL is not needed. Put the
Twitter feed name, the tokens and secrets that the Twitter app gives you into configuration.php

* Download EDICT2 dictionary file from http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict.html

and put in /csv/from_tatoeba.org

* Bot is ready to run with /scripts/start_japxlate_bot.php (you'll
