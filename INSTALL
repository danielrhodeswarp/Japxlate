[] Make an empty MySQL schema called 'japxlate' (or whatever you like)
and dump the structure of /sql/japxlate_structure.sql into it

[] Dump the data from /sql/edict_data.sql.zip into the schema

(it should be the case that the current EDICT file can be downloaded and eaten into the
database with a script in /scripts. Unfortunately, the original script to do
this seems to have vanished!)

[] Rename configuration.php.SAMPLE in /conf to configuration.php 

[] Put your MySQL credentials in above configuration.php

[] You'll need a Twitter account and then a "My application" (so you can get some OAuth access tokens etc). You'll want "Read, Write and Access direct messages" permission. Put the
Twitter feed name, the tokens and secrets that the Twitter app gives you into configuration.php

[] Download jpn_indices.csv, links.csv and sentences.csv from Tatoeba.org
and put in /csv/from_tatoeba.org

[] Run /scripts/eat_tatoeba_project_sentences.csv.php

[] Run /scripts/eat_tatoeba_project_links.csv.php

[] Run /scripts/eat_tatoeba_project_jpn_indices.csv.php

[] Bot is ready to run with /scripts/start_japxlate_bot.php (you'll
probably want to put it in the background or do a nohup if remote)
